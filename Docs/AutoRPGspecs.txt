The following should exist on the Server
	A World should contain:
		-a std::map of pointers to all Characters in the World
		-a collection of Areas
			-how these Areas are linked
	
	An Area should contain:
		-a std::map of pointers to all Characters in the Area
		-a Map for that area
		-collection of Sectors (Maybe not necessary, but might be helpful for collision detection and updating)
			-how these Sectors are linked
	
	A Map should contain:
		-a 2D std::vector of Tiles
		-a method for applying the map at a given location
	
	A Tile should contain:
		-pointer to the Sprite_Sheet containing the sprite(s) for the tile
		-an Animation for the tile (which may be one or many sprites)
		-information about events to pass when a tile is occupied (ie walkable, swimming, life-sapping, etc)
	
	A Sector should contain:
		-a std::map of pointers to all Characters in the Sector
		-pointers to all connecting Sectors
			-information about how to pass between Sectors

The following should exist as a copy on the Client
	-the Sector containing the player, and the 8 Sectors surrounding it
		-information must be passed between client and server about all of the Dynamic_Objects in these sectors
			-Position should be periodically checked
			-Events should be passed and timestamped
				-timestamping allows for retroactive event passing, and minimizes lag-related error
	-collision detection should occur only within the Sector(s) that the player is in (which should simplify collision detection)
