Initializing information
	Level information	
		-Level is generated randomly, pass the seed for initialization

Loop of constant data interaction
	List of all objects
		3 chunks
			-Noninteracting
			-Intractable
			-Characters
			
To implement
	Get and set functions for all objects
		-Characters
		-Dinamic_objects

	Data serializer
		-Get variables from everything
		-Convert to a standard format
	Data parser
		-Parses standard format
		-Set variables in everything
		
Server - manages physics and interaction movements, state changes, and AI
	-Generates level
	-Manages object movement
	-Sends changes to users
Client - User input, sending, and displaying
	-Handles character input and interaction with objects

	Client version 2 take less information from the server, in generate more on your own returns to server
	Server checks the data sends boolean back. Reduces load to 
	
Two protocols UDP & TCP/IP
	UDP
		Advantages
			-Very fast
			-Quick code
		Disadvantages
			-Packet wrapping
			-Failed packets are dropped without knowledge
	TCP/IP
		Advantages
			-Wrappers written for you
			-Almost never used for games
		Disadvantages
			-Big overhead
